# Sum of Squares Art 

<img src = "images/wallpaper_art_1.png?raw=true"/>

While I was working with desmos, I plotted the graph of the equation 
<div align = "center"> 
  ⌊x⌋²  +  ⌊y⌋² ≡ 0  (<b>mod p</b>)
</div> 
for various integers p. It turns out that this equation has non trivial solutions only if p is of the form 4k + 1. This is given by Fermat's Sum of Squares theorem, which states that -1 is a quadratic residue if and only if 
<div align = "center"> 
  p ≡ 1  (<b>mod 4</b>)
</div>
