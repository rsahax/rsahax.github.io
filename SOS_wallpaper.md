# Contour Art with Sum of Squares  

<img src = "images/wallpaper_art_1.png?raw=true"/>

While I was working with desmos, I plotted the graph of the equation 
<br/><br/>
<div align = "center"> 
  ⌊x⌋²  +  ⌊y⌋² ≡ 0  (<b>mod p</b>)
</div> 
<br/><br/>
for various integers p. It turns out that this equation has non trivial solutions only if p is of the form 4k + 1. This is given by Fermat's Sum of Squares theorem, which states that -1 is a quadratic residue if and only if 
<br/><br/>
<div align = "center"> 
  p ≡ 1  (<b>mod 4</b>)
</div> 
<br/><br/>

Since I liked the interesting pattern depicted above, I decided to do a contour plot of the equation on python for a desktop wallpaper. I used Nord's color palette to customize matplotlib's default color scheme. Below are a couple of examples.
